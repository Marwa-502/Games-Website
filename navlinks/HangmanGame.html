        Hangman is the classic word-guessing game where you try to figure out a
        secret word letter by letter. You have a limited number of guesses, and
        with each incorrect guess, part of a cute stick figure gets closer to,
        well, hanging. Can you save your new friend by solving the mystery word
        before it's too late?
