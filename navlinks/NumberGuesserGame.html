        Imagine you're a mind reader, but for numbers! In the Number Guesser
        Game, you pick a number within a specific range, and the game tries to
        guess it. You'll provide hints like "too high" or "too low" until the
        game magically reads your mind and figures out your number. It's like
        telepathy, but with numbers!
